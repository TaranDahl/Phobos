// In vanilla YR, game destroys building animations directly by calling constructor.
// Ares changed this to call UnInit() which has a consequence of doing pointer invalidation on the AnimClass pointer.
// This notably causes an issue with Grinder that restores ActiveAnim if the building is sold/destroyed while SpecialAnim is playing even if the building is gone or in limbo.
// Now it does not do this if the building is in limbo, which covers all cases from being destroyed, sold, to erased by Temporal weapons.
// There is another potential case for this with ProductionAnim & IdleAnim which is also patched here just in case.
